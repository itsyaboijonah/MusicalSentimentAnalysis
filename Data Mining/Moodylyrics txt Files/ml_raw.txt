3 El era un hombre de campo. Oriundo de Nuevo León. Tenía apenas 19 años. Su nombre: José Pérez León.. . Tenía un primo lejano. Que de mojado se fue. Al poco tiempo le envió un telegrama. Diciendo ven pronto José.. . Pues un trabajo le habían encontrando. Piscando algodón como él.. . Y se fue, y se fue. Ahogando en llanto en el adiós. Con su mujer. Se fue, sin saber. Que de ese viaje ya jamás iba a volver. Pobre José.. . Cuando llegó a la frontera. Con Willy se entrevistó. Era el  pollero más afamado. Y astuto de la región. Le dijo Pepe hoy estás de suerte. Mañana te cruzo yo.... . La madrugada de un viernes. En una vieja estación. 20 inocentes pagaban su cuota. Entre ellos José Pérez León. Y sin dudarlo a todos subieron. En el interior de un vagón.. . El tren cruzó al otro lado. Casi 7 horas después. Fue cuando el aire empezó a terminarse. Y ya nada pudieron hacer. Nadie escuchó aquellos gritos de auxilio. Y la puerta no quiso ceder.. . Uno por uno se fueron cayendo. Y asi falleció el buen José.. . Y se fue, y se fue. A cruzar el cielo con sus ancias de crecer. Se fue, sin saber . Que ya su esposa un hijo suyo iba a tener. Pobre José.. . Así termina la historia, no queda más que contar. De otro paisano que arriesga la vida. Y que muere como ilegal. De aquel José que mil sueños tenía y que a casa. Jamás volvera...

4 Writer (s): AUTHOR; Gershwin/Gershwin. . . The man who only lives for making money. Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny. Likewise the man who works for fame. There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name. The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment. Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant. Fall in love and you won't regret it. That's the best work of all, if you can get it. . Holding hands at midnight. 'Neath a starry sky. Nice work if you can get it. And you can get it if you try. Strolling with the one girl.

Who could ask for anything more?. Loving one who loves you. And then taking that vow. It's nice work if you can get it. And if you get it, won't you tell me how?

2 This is times of battle,. This is times of war,. This is time for discipline,. No mercy for a war whore.. Life turns harsh,. But lust does not disappear,. Life turns dark,. But attraction is still there.. To taste the forbidden,. To dance with the wolves,. Erotic deceit,. Pleasure above rules.. This is times of battle,. This is times of war,. This is time for discipline,. No mercy for a war whore.. This game, this flirt, will come to an end. Power will change,. Our nation will rise again,. The hordes will scream for your death,. They will claim revenge,. They will ravage your body,. They will serve you hell.. Spitting in the eyes of your defenders,. With open legs you surrender,. Embracing the muscular overpower,. Our pride you so simply devour.. It is time of battle,. It is time of war,. It is time to be disciplined,. No mercy for a war whore.

3 Mercy don't think she's pretty no more. Starin' at the stars through her back screen door. She tries and tries to make it all work out. No matter what she does. She's left standin' in the middle of doubt. In a lonely day. And in the pourin' rain. You can count on me. . Sometimes she cries. When she's alone at night. Sometimes she weeps. When she's feelin' cold and weak. Sometimes the pain. It just tears her up inside. Sometimes she cries. Ooh, I wonder why. . Mercy don't have a lover no more. She plays with her pillow. Stares at the bedroom floor. Used to have a million. They've come and gone. No matter what she does. She can't figure out what she's doin' wrong. In a lonely night. And in the pourin' rain. You can count on me. . Sometimes she cries. When she's alone at night. Sometimes she weeps. When she's feelin' cold and weak. Sometimes the pain. Oh, it tears her up inside. Sometimes she cries. Ooh yeah. . Livin', lovin', giving everything you got. After all the heartache. Maybe give love just one more shot away. . In a lonely night. And in the pourin' rain. The only thing I really wanna know is why. . Sometimes she cries. When she's alone at night. Sometimes she weeps. When she's feelin' cold and weak. Sometimes the pain. Oh, it tears her up inside. Sometimes she cries. Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know when love's shining in your eyes. It may be the stars falling from above.. And you know love is with you when you rise,. For night and day belong to love

Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating. . You call me on the phone, you left me all alone. All I get from you is shellshock. Another day goes by and all I do is cry. All I get from you is shellshock. I'd tell the world and save my soul. But rain falls down and I feel cold. A cold that sleeps within my heart. It tears the earth and sun apart. But that's the way I can win. A victim of your evil sin. You've lost the hold you've had on me. By causing the changes that you never see. Hold on! it's never enough.

Counting time in one or more ways. We can't find our peace of mind. And life becomes a life of crime. And that's the day I call your name. I came to you, I called in vain. You lost the faith within your heart. The fire in your soul from the end to the start. Hold on! it's never enough. It's never enough until your heart stops beating. The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain. Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating. . I've been good and I've been bad. But common sense I've never had. No matter how I try and try,. I hide the truth behind a lie. But that's the way that I can win. A victim of your evil sin. You lost the faith within your heart. The fire in your soul from the end to the start. Hold on! it's never enough. It's never enough until your heart stops beating. The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain. Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating

Quiero estar junto a ti. Yo no quiero sufrir. Ven y dime que si. Solo vivir. Entregarlo todo, Solo vivir. Chichi!

The ocean's near the shore. I could think of things I never thunk before. And then I'd sit and think some more. . I would not be just a nuffin'. My head all full of stuffin'. My heart all full of pain. I would dance and be merry. Life would be a ding-a-derry. If I only had a brain
3 Te esperei na lua crescer. Ví cadeira boa sentei. Espirrei na tua gripei. Por ficar ao léu resfriei. . Você me agradou me acertou. Me miseravou, me aqueceu. Me rasgou a roupa e valeu. E jurou conversas de deus. . Aganjú. Aganjú. Aganjú. Aganjú. Aganjú. Aganjú. . Quem sabe a labuta quitar. Sabe o trabalho que dá. Batalhar o pão e trazer. Para a casa o sobreviver. . Encontrei na rua a questão. Cem por cento a falta de chão. Vou rezar prá nunca perder. Essa estrutura que é você. . Aganjú. Aganjú. Aganjú. Aganjú. Aganjú. Aganjú
2 Turn the scissors with open blades. All the darkness will burn. Recalling pictures of olden days. All these feelings return. If you're breathing you've been afraid. In the shadows remain. I'll be stalking you night and day. Till you share all my pain. . Now we step into the fire. . Beware you will pay. Ladykiller. I swear you will pay. Ladykiller. . Bait the killer and lie in wait. Till the morning unfolds. Now he's feeding on my mistakes. And the trail has run cold. All the violence that fills the world. Leaving nothing for shame. This is when so much pain will call out. Such things I have learned. . Hear my vow and fear my vengeance. . Beware you will pay. Ladykiller. I swear you will pay. Ladykiller. '"`UNIQ72a980ac1f96ce6b-Lyrics-00000001-QINU`"'

3 La niña duerme tan profundo. Solo un fuego o un disparo. La puede despertar. As inocente apenas tiene nueve años. Y mañana quizas entendera. Que un estraño en su cama. Toco su cuerpecito. Con malicia y sin piedad. Ella no entiende que. Hay personas en la vida. Que se animan solo para hacer maldad. . Y quien diablos fue. Un desgraciado sin corazon. Digame como entro. Quizas olvidaron cerrar la puerta. Solo saben que hizo el daño. Y se marcho. . Al dia siguiente oficiales. Preguntaban a sus padres. Como fue que sucedio. La madre sufre y el padre pensativo. No hubo huellas de aquel que la violo. La niña nunca se imagina que ayer mientras dormia algo malo le paso. Mas ve el sangriento en su ropa. Policias en su cuarto. Y un poquito de dolor. . Y quien diablos fue. Un desgraciado sin corazon. Digame como entro. Quizas olvidaron cerrar la puerta. Solo saben que hizo el daño. Y se marcho. . Como es posible que alguien pueda hacer daño a un angelito de Dios. La niña solo tenia nueve años. Y un malvao' la violo. Aqui les traigo otra historia a la gente. Y esta vez no es de amor.

Se le hace dificil dormir. No se divierte y sus muñecas. Tienen polvo ya no juega. Nadie la ve reir. Y otra noche de martirio pesadillas del pasado que la hacen sufrir. Ya son las tres de la mañana. Y la niña en llanto se duerme por fin. . Y volvio. El mismo desgraciado sin corazon. Pero como de nuevo entro . No se imaginan como lo hizo. Nunca hubo una puerta abierta . Y esta vez la niña desperto. . Papi que tu haces

Sit there and count your little fingers. Unlucky little girl blue. . Sit there and count the raindrops. Falling on you. It's time you knew. All you can count on is the raindrops. That fall on little girl blue. . No use old girl. You may as well surrender. Your hope is getting slender. Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy. To cheer up little girl blue. . When I was very young. The world was younger than I. As merry as a carousel. The circus tent was strung with every star in the sky. Above the ring I love so well. Now the young world has grown old. Gone are the tinsel and gold. . All you can count on is the raindrops

2 (John Legend). Oh, the fire, the fire. Oh, the fire, the fire. . (Chorus: John Legend). There's something in your heart. And it's in your eyes. It's the fire, inside you. Let it burn. You don't say good luck. You say don't give up. It's the fire, inside you. Let it burn. . (Black Thought). Yeah, and if I'm ever at the crossroads. And start feeling mixed signals like Morse code. My soul start to grow colder than the North Pole. I try to focus on the hole of where the torch goes. In the tradition of these legendary sports pros. As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold. Lord knows I've waited for this a lifetime. And I'm an icon when I let my light shine. Shine bright as an example of a champion. Taking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling. Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it. Maverick, always above and beyond average. Fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with. Something in my eyes say I'm so close to having the prize. I realise I'm supposed to reach for the skies. Never let somebody try to tell you otherwise. . (Black Thought). One love, one game, one desire. One flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher. I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired. 'Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph. It's David and Goliath, I made it to the eye of. The storm, feeling torn like they fed me to the lions. Before my time start to wind down like the Mayans. I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science. It sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet. The only thing I hear is my heart, I'm inspired. By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with. Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward. You can't escape the history that you was meant to make. That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take. You came to celebrate, I came to sever great. I hate losing, I refuse to make the same mistake. . (John Legend). Oh, the fire, the fire. Oh, the fire, the fire. . (John Legend). Oh, the fire inside you. The fire inside you. The fire inside you. The fire inside you

3 Conquistador your stallion stands . In need of company . And like some angel's haloed brow . You reek of purity . I see your armour-plated breast . Has long since lost its sheen . And in your death mask face . There are no signs which can be seen . . And though I hoped for something to find . I could see no maze to unwind . . Conquistador a vulture sits . Upon your silver shield . And in your rusty scabbard now . The sand has taken seed . And though your jewel-encrusted blade . Has not been plundered still . The sea has washed across your face . And taken of its fill . . And though I hoped for something to find . I could see no maze to unwind . . Conquistador there is no time . I must pay my respect . And though I came to jeer at you . I leave now with regret . And as the gloom begins to fall . I see there is no, only all . And though you came with sword held high . You did not conquer, only die . . And though I hoped for something to find . I could see no maze to unwind

3 Strap my derriere to a padded chair. I fly the air in a tin can. From here to there on a wing and a prayer. I don't even know where I am. I'm a wanderin fool burnin fossil fuel. Sending arrows into the dark. But I'm just lookin' for a place where I can fall apart. . Throw all of my junk into the Alamo trunk. And I pull out into the lane.

3 Y es que fueron, fueron tus abrazos. Que como sablazos me hicieron pedazos. Afiladas fueron tus miradas. Quedé destrozada y en llanto inundada. Roja y loca la flama de tu boca. Me quemó y apagarme me toca. Empiezo una nueva vida. Un rompecabezas que tendré que armar. Bien lejos, lejos de su influjo. De esa cruel fragancia, que invadió mi ser. De la maleza surgieron. Tus promesas. Germinando tristeza en mi cabeza. Tu bajeza me tomó por sorpresa. Para lastimar. Tienes mucha destreza. Qué delicia fueron tus caricias. Mala noticia eran pura malicia. Empiezo. Una nueva vida. De esa extravagancia que torció mi fe. Ya no quiero ir hacia usted corriendo. Ya no quiero más gritar su nombre. Bien lejos, lejos de su influjo. De la casi muerte que fue su querer.

3 La tarde esta en su lugar. Hoy el cielo se viste de añil. Sin rumbo voy por la cuidad. Esta isla esta llena de ti. Arena y mar sol tropical. Y tu, tu no estas aquí. La radio esta tocando ya. Aquella canción que habla de ti. Tal vez me quede en un bar. A ver la noche llegar. . San Juan sin ti. Es un espejismo desde que no estas aquí. San Juan sin ti. Ya no se que pensar. Ya no se donde ir. . San Juan sin ti. Ya no es lo mismo. Te necesito junto a mi. San Juan sin ti. Todo me sale mal. Esta isla esta llena de ti. . San Juan si ti. Y aún te quiero, y aún te amo. Uh, Uh, Uh, San Juan si ti. San Juan sin ti, San Juan sin ti. San Juan sin ti. Es un espejismo. Hoy me pregunto porque no estas aquí. Esa calle y nuestra primera cita. Viven presente siempre aquí. Ya no es lo mismo. Te necesito vuelve a mi. . Ya no se que pensar. Ya no se donde ir. Cuando aquella canción me habla de ti. Con mis recuerdos voy sin rumbo. Que aquí te espera un amor profundo. En cada cosa siempre tu. Esta isla está llena de ti
3 Amanecer con él. a mi costado no es igual que estar contigo. no es que este mal, ni hablar. pero le falta madurar, es casi un niño.. Blanco como el yogur. sin ese toro que tu llevas en el pecho. fragilidad de flor. nada que ver con mi perverso favorito.. . Sin tus uñas arañandome la espalda,. sin tus manos que me estrujan todo cambia,. sin tu lengua envenenado mi garganta,. sin tus dientes que torturan y endulzan yo no siento nada.. . Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no,. no es la misma cosa, no hay estrellas de color rosa. no destilan los poros del cuerpo. ambrosía salpicada de te quieros.. Hacer el amor con otro no, no no. Es como no hacer nada falta fuego en la mirada. Falta dar el ama en cada beso. y sentir que puedes alacanzar el cielo. . Quise olvidarte con él,. quise vengar todas tus infidelidades. y me salió tan mal. que hasta me cuesta respirar su mismo aire.. . Los mechones de tu pelo negro crespo,. tus caderas afiladas y escurridas,. esa barba que raspaba como lija. y tu sonrisa retorcida son lo mejor que hay en mi vida.. . Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no,. no es la misma cosa, no hay estrellas de color rosa. no destilan los poros del cuerpo. ambrosía salpicada de te quieros.. Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no,. es como no hacer nada, falta fuego en la mirada. falta dar el alma en cada beso. y sentir que puedes alcanzar el cielo.

To ascend to the Trial Of Champions. Every fight a battle to the death. Your fate lies in the hands of fools. A meager wager more precious than your life. When the thumb comes down. You know just what to do. Kill! Kill! Kill. It's your time. Do what must be done. Every day you fight. Every day you win. Taking the life of the Emperor. The ultimate reward for surviving the Trial. You will not die in chains. A champion you are

2 I got mad at history. Picked it up and fell in love with everything. Men and pen and paper. Like the wind you let 'em in now they'll never leave.. Run from the gun don't be afraid. Run from the gun where the dead lay. Run from the gun don't be afraid. Run from the gun.... You were sweet as poison. Dried my mouth took me out and left me glad. You did me no favors. It was dumb and the last one that I ever had. Run from the gun don't be afraid. Run from the gun where the dead lay. Run from the gun don't be afraid. Run from the gun.... It was loaded with the pressure. Too much pressure to be measured. I was holding off the wrong and the right.... I got let down gently. Never even knew the end was on the way.

Where the manic, depressive psycho murderers stalk. Walk, like a ninja, on the asphalt. Here talk is cheap, you're outlined in chalk. And there's more hardtimes, than on Good Times. And most niggaz dedicate their life to crime. So I'm steady schemin, won't work for a dime. Used to get, tax free loot, all the time. Type slick can't fess on 'Ru, because. Verse Two:.

Challenge the Damaja, and you'll be history. Mortal Kombat fatality, the original don't sing no R&B. Nasty MC deity. Chop off domes with the poems that come out of my pin-eal. Gland, as I expand, you know who I am. Verse Three:. Father of all stylin, I be whylin on wax. We hack shit up like big ax and little ax. Don't need tokes to make you jump like bungee. Tracks real muddy, like Brooklyn's real grungy. When I come through I clog up your sewer. Peep the maneuveur, drop the ill manure. So bring Mr. Clean, Drano, and Roto Rooter. No matter what you do, you can't get through the. Crud that comes out of your system. You're another victim, of dirty rotten. Dirt up, in your grill, so what ya gonna do. But pay homage to...
